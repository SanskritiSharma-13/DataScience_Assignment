# Data Science Assignment: eCommerce Transactions

## Overview

This repository contains the solution for the Data Science assignment, focusing on eCommerce transactions. The task includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), building a Lookalike Model, and performing customer segmentation using clustering techniques on a given dataset consisting of customer, product, and transaction data.

The code for this project was developed and executed on **Google Colab**, leveraging its cloud-based Python environment for data analysis, modeling, and visualization.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of three files:

1. **Customers.csv**: Contains customer information, including a unique identifier, name, region, and signup date.
2. **Products.csv**: Contains product details, including a unique identifier, name, category, and price.
3. **Transactions.csv**: Contains transaction details, including the transaction ID, customer ID, product ID, transaction date, quantity, total value, and price.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights
- Perform EDA on the dataset.
- Derive at least 5 business insights from the data.

### Task 2: Lookalike Model
- Build a Lookalike Model that takes a user's information as input and recommends 3 similar customers based on their profile and transaction history.

### Task 3: Customer Segmentation / Clustering
- Perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques based on customer profiles and transaction data.
- Use clustering metrics such as DB Index for evaluation.
- Visualize the clusters using relevant plots.

## Files

- **Sanskriti_Sharma_EDA.pdf**: Report containing insights derived from the EDA.
- **Sanskriti_Sharma_EDA.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for the EDA process (executed on Google Colab).
- **Sanskriti_Sharma_Lookalike.csv**: CSV file containing the recommended lookalike customers and similarity scores.
- **Sanskriti_Sharma_Lookalike.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for the Lookalike model development (executed on Google Colab).
- **Sanskriti_Sharma_Clustering.pdf**: Report containing the clustering results and DB Index value.
- **Sanskriti_Sharma_Clustering.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for the clustering process (executed on Google Colab).
